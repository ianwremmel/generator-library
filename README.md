A generator for [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io).


## Getting Started

Make sure you've install Yeoman.

```bash
$ npm install -g yo
```

To install generator-library, fork this repository, clone your repository, and, in the new directory, run:

```bash
$ npm link
```

Finally, invoke the generator from your new project directory:

```bash
$ yo library
```

### generator-library

generator-library is a yeoman generator built for ianwremmel's workflow preferences. At its core, it's a very lightweight set of preferences, but overtime will expand for many of the various project types he works on.

It is unlikely to ever end up in npm.

#### Assumptions

- If you're doing anything in the frontend, you'll be using browserify.
- Your name is `Ian W. Remmel` and all your projects will be `Copyright (c) Ian W. Remmel`.

## TODO

- Add in-browser tests
- Solve the lodash/underscore problem
- Setup dependent prompts
- Add question about private vs public and use gitlab badges as appropriate
- Ensure postinstall is run even if includeBower is false
- Githooks to check tests for `it.only`, `describe.only`
- add build-before-push or configure build server to commit built version
- consider automatically bumping the patch version on every successful build
- get karma from wx-js-sdk
